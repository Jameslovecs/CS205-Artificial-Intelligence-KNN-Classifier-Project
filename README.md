# Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Project

• Implemented a Nearest Neighbor Classifier by Python using an annealing algorithm, forward
selection algorithm and backward elimination algorithm respectively.

• Improved the classification accuracy for big dataset by integrating annealing algorithm with
backward selection algorithm.
